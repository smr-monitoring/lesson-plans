## Learning objectives

* Define *discrete* and *continuous* data
* Describe factors that should be considered when selecting a continuous monitoring site
* Describe factors that should be considered when designing a continuous monitoring system (which variables to measure, installation design, etc.)
* Program and deploy continuous monitoring loggers
* Retrieve data from continuous monitoring loggers
* Properly name and organize continuous monitoring data files

### 4. Logger deployment practice

**HOBO pH**

First download the HoboConnect app on your smart phone.

a. Using the [HOBO pH logger SOP](https://smr-monitoring.github.io/sop/ph-logger-hobo.html) as a guide, play around with the logger to make sure you can:
      
    * Identify the pH sensor
    * Remove the sensor storage cap and screw on the deployment cap
    * Connect to the logger
    * Program start and end date and time
    * Program your desired sampling interval
  
b. Be careful not to touch the sensor bulb - it is very delicate. Also don't let the sensor sit out in the air for too long - if it dries, it dies!

c. Inspect the o-ring. Clean and lubricate if necessary.   

c. Program the logger to start 5 min from now, end 15 minutes from now, and collect a sample every 30 seconds.

d. Attach the logger to the brick using zip ties following the instructor's guidance and place in a tub of water after you have also attached your DO logger. 


**PME MiniDOT oxygen/temp**



a. Using the [PME MiniDOT SOP](https://smr-monitoring.github.io/sop/do-logger-pme.html), familiarize yourself with the instrument. Make sure you can:

    * identify the protective cap and the oxygen sensor
    * remove the protective rubber cap and unscrew the body/housing tube from the black sensor head. Sometimes it sticks, so don't be afraid to use some elbow grease. Removing the sensor head will expose the inner electronics, so be careful and make sure the instrument and your surroundings are completely dry. It's ok if the dessicant packet falls out - just don't lose it.
  
b. Start the logger. These loggers are not as easily customizable as the HOBOs but they are easier to deploy: once you have unscrewed the sensor head, all you need to do is turn the switch on to the "Record" position. It will record data every 5 minutes.

c. Attach the logger to the brick using zip ties following the instructor's guidance and place in a tub of water after you have also attached your light/temp logger. 

### 5. Practice retrieval

a. After your 10-minute deployment is complete, remove the loggers from the tub and remove from the block. Don't cut any reusable zip-ties.

b. Dry the oxygen logger thoroughly with paper towels, then carefully open it. Wipe off any residual moisture on the o-ring/threads of the sensor head. Switch the logger off to the "Halt" position.

c. Connect the oxygen logger to your computer using the supplied cable. It should be visible in your Finder/File explorer as an external D drive. Follow the Data Retrieval instructions in the [SOP](https://smr-monitoring.github.io/sop/do-logger-pme.html). If you are unable to open the Concatenate program, you may need to [install Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html) on your computer.

d. Save the exported file to our shared [conmon-practice](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1c7jRuruyRQ1XK1NwUmhh8p1N0XJrPela?usp=sharing) Google Drive folder. Rename the file using the following convention: YYYY-MM-DD_DO_GROUPX. 

e. Connect to your light/temp logger using the HOBOConnect app. Follow the post-processing and offloading data instructions in the [SOP](https://smr-monitoring.github.io/sop/light-temp-logger-hobo.html). Download and view the data in your app. Then save it as a .csv file and export it to our [conmon-practice](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1c7jRuruyRQ1XK1NwUmhh8p1N0XJrPela?usp=sharing) shared Google Drive folder. Rename the file using the following convention: YYYY-MM-DD_LIGHT_GROUPX.

f. Repeat step e for the pH logger. Rename the file using the following convention: YYYY-MM-DD_PH_GROUPX.
