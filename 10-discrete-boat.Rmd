## Details

We'll be taking discrete water quality samples from the boat today in two groups:

- Brooke, Adrianna, Savannah, Sophia, Graham meet in the River Center lab at 12:20
  
- Noah, Liam, Leah, Kemper meet at the dock at 1:45 (you can put your backpacks, etc. in the River Center lab before going on the boat)

**Make sure to dress warm**, ideally with a wind-proof outer layer. Avoid cotton jeans/sweats. Wear waterproof boots or sneakers.
