## Housekeeping

* HW for next week: be able to tie the bowline, lobster buoy hitch, and half hitch. 3 points: tie each knot in less than 30 seconds; 2 points tie 2 of the knots in less than 30 seconds; 1 point: tie one of the knots in less than 30 seconds
* Next week we will learn how to program and deploy continuous monitoring instruments. 

## Learning objectives

* Tie a bowline, lobster buoy hitch, and half hitch knot
* Calibrate YSI pH, DO, and conductivity

## Resources
