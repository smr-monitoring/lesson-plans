## Housekeeping

* HW3 is due in class next week
* This week and next week, we'll be in the classroom and down on the dock

## Learning objectives

* Describe diel and seasonal patterns of estuarine dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration and discuss the factors that affect DO
* Explain why pH tends to co-vary with DO
* Define annual phytoplankton primary production (APPP)
* Describe the factors controlling APPP
* Explain potential sources of error when measuring APPP
* Explain how the light-dark bottle method is used to measure NPP and be able to use this method to conduct NPP measurements

## Resources

* [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MgM5Z4uUarYjLK5xzwsgypnZbPeSc4wGrWdinE2ZOvE/)
* [Cloern et al. 2014: Phytoplankton primary production in the worldâ€™s estuarine-coastal ecosystems](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xvtN3hTXM4mrdZEIglD65oEDWkiIDRhY/view?usp=sharing)

## Lesson plan

1. Go over HW2

2. Slides on NPP

3. Read through [Net Primary Production SOP](https://smr-monitoring.github.io/sop/npp.html)

3. Knot-tying: the bowline. Instructional videos for all of the knots you'll need to learn, including the bowline, are available on the [Knot-tying page](https://smr-monitoring.github.io/MRNE395-2024FA/knot-tying.html)

3. Take NPP readings at the waterfront. Rotate through "stations":
    * Basic water quality measurements: YSI, LiCOR profile, secchi
    * Play with pump to fill NPP bottles
    * Final NPP DO readings
    * Practice the bowline (and other knots if you'd like)
