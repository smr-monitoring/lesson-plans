## Housekeeping

* HW3 is due in class next week
* This week and next week, we'll be in the classroom and down on the dock

## Learning objectives

* Describe diel and seasonal patterns of estuarine dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration and discuss the factors that affect DO
* Explain why pH tends to co-vary with DO
* Define annual phytoplankton primary production (APPP)
* Describe the factors controlling APPP
* Explain potential sources of error when measuring APPP

## Resources

* [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MgM5Z4uUarYjLK5xzwsgypnZbPeSc4wGrWdinE2ZOvE/)
