## Housekeeping

* I'll hand out paper copies of HW-02 in class today.
* If you miss class, you can grab a copy of the homework from the envelope next to my office door (Kent 308)

## Learning objectives

* Define designated use and summarize the five designated uses of the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem
* Explain how water quality attainment criteria for dissolved oxygen, SAV/water clarity, and chlorophyll a are derived
* Follow proper procedures to filter water for chl a and TSS using a vacuum pump
* Explain how concentrations are derived from chl a and TSS filtrate

## Resources

* [Slides on WQ criteria](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lXwrBQ09VPu7JXGHzPzio329Imnn8pGG9BIEbH7v69Y/)

## Lesson plan

### 1. Go over HW-01

As we discuss [HW-01](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nurX4BWtdfR9zJBLjk3Bw-OtvYs28MPMHCWu9FV5x-4/), please use a different-colored pen to mark up your homework to correct questions you got wrong, flesh out incomplete answers, etc. This will help me see where I might need to provide more instruction.

### 2. Slides on WQ criteria and filtering

### 3. Filter for chl *a* and TSS

1. Go out and collect water samples. Each person from each group should collect their own sample so that everyone has a chance to filter. 
2. Using the SOPs linked below, filter water samples for later TSS and chl *a* analysis.

* [Chl *a* SOP](https://smr-monitoring.github.io/sop/chl-filtering.html)
